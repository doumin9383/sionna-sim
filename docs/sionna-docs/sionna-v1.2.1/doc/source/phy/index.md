# Physical Layer (PHY)

This package provides a differentiable link-level simulator.

It seamlessly integrates multiple communication system elements,
including `forward error correction (FEC) <api/fec>`,
`multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems <api/mimo>`,
`orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) <api/ofdm>`, and a
range of `wireless <api/channel.wireless>` and
`optical <api/channel.optical>` channel models. It also supports
simulation of some `5G NR <api/nr>` compliant features.

The best way to get started is by going through some of the
`Tutorials <tutorials>`.

Advanced users may want to consult the
`Developer Guides <developer/developer>` for a deeper understanding of
the inner workings of Sionna PHY and to learn how to extended it with
custom physical layer algorithms.
