Large-scale scenario data often exceeds available RAM when loaded as a single monolithic block.\n\nTo improve scalability and integration with local workstation environments, I propose adding a structured ingestion utility that leverages `xarray` and `Zarr` for chunked, out-of-core data processing.\n\n### Proposed Workflow\nThe pipeline should follow a \"Stream-and-Chunk\" strategy:\n1.  **Lazy Inspection**: Use `h5py` to inspect the metadata and hierarchy of the source HDF5 file without loading the entire payload.\n2.  **Generator-based Ingestion**: Implement a generator that yields data on a per-site or per-region basis.\n3.  **Intermediate Zarr Conversion**: Store the processed data into a Zarr store with optimized chunk sizes. This allows for:\n    * **Near-zero RAM overhead**: Only the current chunk is in memory.\n    * **Fast Random Access**: Efficiently retrieve specific paths during the main simulation loop.\n    * **Dask Compatibility**: Enabling parallel computation across multiple CPU/GPU cores.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n-   **Abstraction Layer**: A flexible \"Data Adapter\" class that maps arbitrary HDF5 keys (e.g., path loss, delay, angles) to a standard schema.\n-   **Sionna Integration**: A utility function to convert the resulting Zarr/xarray dataset into a format compatible with `sionna.rt.Paths`.\n-   **Robust Error Handling**: Mechanism to handle potential schema mismatches or missing attributes in external datasets.\n\n### Use Case\nThis feature will enable the use of high-fidelity, large-scale external ray-tracing outputs within the Sionna ecosystem for advanced PHY-layer research (e.g., Cell-Free Massive MIMO) without requiring enterprise-grade server memory.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doumin9383/sionna-sim/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doumin9383/sionna-sim/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
